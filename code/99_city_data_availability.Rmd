This file gives the status of open crime data in the [50 largest US cities by
population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) 
as of June 2018. Cities are listed in descending order of population.

City data are suitable for including in CODE if at least four years of data
are available on all crimes.


# New York, NY

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Los Angeles, CA

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Chicago, IL

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Houston, TX

No open crime data are available. There is a recent incidents dataset but it 
only covers calls for service over the past month.


# Phoenix, AZ

Only [Part 1 data from November 2015](https://phoenixopendata.com/dataset/crime-data)
are available.


# Philadelphia

Data are [available from 2006 onwards](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents) 
and appear to include [a code that can be used to match crime types](http://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543868920583086178c4f8e/representationdetails/570e7621c03327dc14f4b68d/). However, there is only a dispatch time and no offence 
time.


# San Antonio, TX

No open crime data are available. There is a [San Antonio PD Open Data 
Initiative](http://www.sanantonio.gov/SAPD/SAPD-Open-Data-Initiative), but it
only relates to officer data (e.g. use of force).


# San Diego, CA

No open crime data are available. [CFS data are available](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-calls-for-service/), 
but aren't translatable to crimes.


# Dallas, TX (possible)

Crime data are [available from June 2014 onwards](https://www.dallasopendata.com/Public-Safety/Police-Incidents/tbnj-w5hb)
and appear to include categories that could be matched to the CODE categories.


# San Jose, CA

No open crime data are available.


# Austin, TX

Data are [available](https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?Additional-Information_Department=Austin+Police+&category=Public+Safety&limitTo=datasets&q=APD%20Incident%20Extract&sortBy=relevance&utf8=✓), 
but only for years up to 2010 and then the current year. Most offenses have no
co-ordinates and none have addresses.


# Jacksonville, FL

No open crime data are available.


# San Francisco, CA

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Columbus, OH

No open crime data are available.


# Fort Worth, TX

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Indianapolis, IN

Data are only available for UCR Part 1 crimes.


# Charlotte, NC

No open crime data are available.


# Seattle, WA

Data [appear to be available](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-Police-Report-Incident/7ais-f98f), 
with some cases excluded, for several years. However, the website suggests these
data will be removed in September 2018. Since they are CC0 licensed, they can
continue to be used even after they are withdrawn from the Seattle Open Data
website. Unfortunately there are substantial jumps in the number of crimes of
many types between years, suggesting some unknown and changing factor 
influencing the number of crimes.


# Denver, CO

Data are [available for the previous five years](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime).
However, "crimes which by their nature involve juveniles, or which the reports 
indicate involve juveniles as victims, suspects, or witnesses, are not reported 
at all."


# Washington, DC

No open crime data are available.


# Boston, MA

Data are [available from August 2015 onwards](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system/resource/12cb3883-56f5-47de-afa5-3b1cf61b257b) with fields that could be used to
create CODE categories. A previous dataset is available back to 2012, but there
is a problem in that a higher proportion of offenses have missing locations in
the first six months of 2015, so the data can't be used to produce a continuous
time series.


# El Paso, TX

No open crime data are available.


# Detroit, MI

Data are available and included in CODE.


# Nashville, TN

No open crime data are available.


# Memphis, TN

No open crime data are available.


# Portland, OR

Data are [available back to at least 2015](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/71978)
but are *slightly* difficult to download due to being run on Tableau Public.
A substantial minority of cases have neither co-ordinates nor addresses.
